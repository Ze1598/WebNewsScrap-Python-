# WebNewsScrap-Python-
Articles, posts, features, news, ..., I scrape from various websites using Python (and BeautifulSoup)

These can be used to create .txt files with multiple articles from a particular website, but my primary intention was to \
use these for my Twitter Bot

Update log:

-(feb. 18th 2018): Added google_queries/googlequeries.py, a script that scrapes the first 10 results (the first page) of a google text query (1-word queries)
